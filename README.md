This repository contains the private commercial implementation of DraftPaper. Do not publish this repository or mirror its implementation details into the public open-source repository.

The commercial edition keeps the full staged workflow, including local data analysis processing, methods hard gates, result validity checks, results writing, LaTeX assembly, Codex skill orchestration, and quality gate logic. The public repository should expose only the literature analysis and validation layer used for product demonstration and lead generation.

DraftPaper CLI is a local-first research paper workflow engine. It turns a research idea, local data, verified method code, result artifacts, and traceable literature evidence into a staged LaTeX manuscript draft. The core is a Python package plus CLI; Codex skills, desktop UI, Web UI, and future API/SaaS layers should call the same core workflow rather than reimplementing it.

## What It Does

DraftPaper CLI organizes one paper as one local project directory and advances it through explicit stages: project creation, literature search, journal template profiling, research planning, Introduction, Data, Methods, Results, Discussion, LaTeX assembly, PDF review, and quality gates.

The reference workflow uses free literature providers first, including Semantic Scholar, arXiv, Crossref, and optional SerpApi. It writes BibTeX, citation evidence, literature notes, HTML paper summaries, and context-aware evidence for Introduction, Data, and Methods. When data or method references lack readable abstract evidence, DraftPaper can call the vendored `paper-fetch-skill` runtime through `paper_fetch_adapter.py` to fetch full-text Markdown/JSON evidence.

## Key Features

- Single-paper local project model with staged manifests.
- State machine commands for rerun, stale-stage tracking, and validation.
- Context-aware literature retrieval for `idea`, `data`, and `methods`.
- Traceable `citation_evidence.csv` for auditable manuscript claims.
- Journal profile stage for target-journal LaTeX constraints.
- Methods hard gate requiring successful local code execution.
- Result validity gate before Results writing.
- Results no-citation enforcement.
- LaTeX assembly with optional local PDF compilation.
- Quality gate for citations, result artifacts, stale stages, and journal template checks.
- Codex skill wrapper that remains only a calling layer.

## Public Scope

This public repository is an implementation-oriented CLI foundation. It intentionally keeps product strategy, prompt recipes, commercial orchestration details, and discipline-specific writing heuristics out of the README. Those should live in private deployment notes or a commercial wrapper repository.

## Project Layout

```text
draftpaper_cli/                 # Core Python package and CLI stages
codex_skills/draftpaper-workflow # Optional Codex skill wrapper
docs/                           # Workflow design and priority guide
tests/                          # Unit tests
third_party/paper-fetch-skill/   # Vendored MIT paper-fetch runtime
github_submit/                  # GitHub submission package and notes
```

Generated paper projects are stored under `projects/` locally and are intentionally ignored by git to avoid uploading research data, generated drafts, full-text paper caches, and result artifacts.

## Quick Start

### Use Through Codex

The intended product workflow is to let Codex read this repository and call the DraftPaper CLI for you. After cloning the repository locally, open or point Codex to the repository directory and ask in natural language, for example:

```text
Use the DraftPaper CLI in C:\Draftpaper_commercial to create a paper project for this idea, search literature, write the research plan, and tell me which stages are blocked.
```

Codex should then run the appropriate CLI commands, inspect the generated local project files, and report the next stage. The raw `draftpaper` commands below are the underlying interface for debugging, automation, and non-Codex use; they are not meant to replace normal conversation with Codex.

### One-Command Local Setup

Run this from the directory where you want to place the repository. The command clones the private repository, creates a local virtual environment, installs DraftPaper CLI, and prints the CLI help. The paper-fetch runtime is vendored in `third_party/paper-fetch-skill`; install it separately only when full-text fetching is needed.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "git clone https://github.com/xiejhhhhhh/Draftpaper_commercial.git; cd Draftpaper_commercial; py -3 -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -U pip; .\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e .; .\.venv\Scripts\draftpaper --help"
```

Optional full-text fetch runtime:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e third_party\paper-fetch-skill
```

After setup, the installed `draftpaper` command can be used from the repository root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\draftpaper create-project --root .\projects --idea "Your research idea" --field "machine learning astronomy" --target-journal APJS
.\.venv\Scripts\draftpaper search-literature --project .\projects\your_project --query "topic keywords"
.\.venv\Scripts\draftpaper validate-project --project .\projects\your_project
```

For a quick local smoke test without live literature search, create and validate a project:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\draftpaper create-project --root .\projects --idea "X-ray flaring source classification" --field "machine learning astronomy" --target-journal APJS
.\.venv\Scripts\draftpaper validate-project --project .\projects\x-ray-flaring-source-classification
```

### Editable Install

```powershell
python -m pip install -e .
python -m draftpaper_cli.cli create-project --root C:\DraftPaper_CLI\projects --idea "Your research idea" --field "machine learning astronomy" --target-journal APJS
python -m draftpaper_cli.cli search-literature --project C:\DraftPaper_CLI\projects\your_project --query "topic keywords"
python -m draftpaper_cli.cli validate-project --project C:\DraftPaper_CLI\projects\your_project
```

Run tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Implementation Status

The CLI already includes staged commands for project state, literature search, journal profile resolution, research plan generation, Introduction, data inventory and feasibility checks, method-plan collection, method execution verification, Methods writing, result validity checks, result inventory, Results writing, Discussion, LaTeX assembly, PDF compilation, and final quality checks.

The current Methods and Results hard gates are implemented as verification and writing gates. `verify-methods` runs project-local code supplied by the user or generated externally, records `methods/run_manifest.yaml`, and blocks Methods writing until declared outputs exist. The repository does not yet include a standalone CLI command that automatically generates new analysis code from literature plus method notes. That code-generation layer should be added as a separate paid workflow stage before `verify-methods` if the product needs end-to-end automatic data/method analysis code creation.

## Paper Fetch Integration

This repository vendors [`Dictation354/paper-fetch-skill`](https://github.com/Dictation354/paper-fetch-skill) under `third_party/paper-fetch-skill`. The adapter prefers a `paper-fetch` command on `PATH`; if unavailable, it can use the vendored runtime source. For a clean environment:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e third_party\paper-fetch-skill
```

The third-party runtime is MIT licensed. Keep its license notice when redistributing.
